#DESCRPTION
I'll create a comprehensive speech recognition system that demonstrates command-based device control. While we can't actually control embedded boards from this web environment, I'll build a fully functional demo that uses the Web Speech API and simulates device interactions.

Core Features:

Real-time speech recognition using Web Speech API
Command parsing for device control (lights, temperature, security, etc.)
Visual feedback for recognized commands and device states
Voice command history and system status
Microphone controls and audio visualization
Responsive design for various screen sizes
Design Elements:
Modern dashboard layout with dark theme and accent colors
Real-time audio visualization during speech recognition
Device control cards with status indicators and animations
Command history panel with timestamps
Clean typography and intuitive controls
Smooth transitions and micro-interactions
Speech Recognition System for Device Control
npm install
src/components/SpeechRecognition.tsx
src/App.tsx
npm run dev
I've created a comprehensive speech recognition system for command-based device control. The system features a modern dashboard with real-time speech recognition, device status monitoring, and command history tracking. The interface uses the Web Speech API to capture voice commands and processes them to control various simulated smart home devices including lights, thermostats, security systems, and power controls.
The system includes visual audio feedback during speech recognition, a clean device status panel showing real-time states, and maintains a history of all processed commands. While this demo simulates device control in the browser, the architecture is designed to easily integrate with actual embedded boards through IoT protocols like MQTT, WebSockets, or REST APIs.
